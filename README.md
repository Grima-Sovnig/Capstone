# Capstone
 Senior Capstone Project
This project was a overhaul of Urban Sciences current SFTP Pipeline. It consilidates their many python scripts for each SFTP connection into an easy to use graphical interface. Connections and preset data is stored into a database that can then be pulled from to make frequent uploads faster. The program also supports task scheduling through PowerShell.
